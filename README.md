# A3Grading

Janky JavaScript grading comment gathering. The entire document is created in genDoc. 

* genTitle(title) - creates the title
* genTopic(topic) - create a topic header
* genMaC(issue) - Major grading criterion
* genMiC(issue) - Minor grading criterion
* genNoC(issue) - Note or Non criterion

Choose all grading issues that apply and press the copy button for a quick and dirty list with counts of 
major and minor issues. If the copy to clipbaord is checked, well, that should be self explanatory. 

The clear button clears the text and unchecks all of the criterion.
